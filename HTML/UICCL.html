<h1>Universally Islam is a complete code of life</h1>
<img src="" alt="Server Error">
<p>Islam is an all-embracing way of life. It extends over the entire spectrum of life, 
    showing us how to conduct all human activities in a sound and wholesome manner. It does
    not allow a hierarchy of priests or intermediaries between Allah and human beings, no 
    farfetched abstractions and no complicated rites and rituals.
</p>
<p>
    Everybody can readily understand the Quran and follow in the footsteps of the Prophet  
    sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) (may Allah exalt his mention), 
    to the best of his or her ability, assured by Allah that He will accept the deeds that each soul 
    has the ability to offer (what means): "On no soul does Allah place a burden greater than it can 
    bear." [Quran 2:286]
</p>
<p>
    When we read the Quran or the Prophetic traditions, we find instructions regarding all aspects 
    of life: political, social, economic, material, ethical, national and international. These instructions 
    provide us with all the details needed to perform a certain act.
</p>
<p>
    The Prophetic traditions go as far as showing us all the steps we need to follow, even the etiquette of 
    using the bathroom: supplications to be said upon entering it and leaving it, how to clean ourselves properly 
    and so on.
</p>
<p>
    To summarize, Islam governs a Muslim's life in all its aspects. This is the reason why it is not only a religion but also a way of life. 
</p>
<P>
Islam does not recognize any kind of separation between religion and life. It openly rejects the Western saying: "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and unto God what is God's"; for everything should be dedicated to God alone and a Muslim is required to submit himself completely to the Will of Allah in all his affairs (what means): "Say: ‘Truly, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the worlds. No partner has He: this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit to His Will.’" [Quran 6:162]

</p>
<p>
    Islam does not believe in wishful thinking. It clearly states that righteous conduct must be followed by belief in Allah. The Quran says (what means): "For those who believe and work deeds of righteousness is a reward that will never (fail)." [Quran 41:8]

</p>
<p>
    And (what means):"Those who believe and work righteousness, joy is for them and a blissful place of (final) return." [Quran 13:29]

Islam, as the revealed Religion from Allah, is comprehensive and perfect. Its Divine Book, the Quran, is the most comprehensive book available to mankind for guidance ¾ nothing has been omitted from it.
</p>
<h4>
    In order to guide mankind to the Right Religion, Allah has completed His Divine Favor upon us by making Islam the Perfect Religion. The last message that Allah has sent to His Messenger, Prophet Muhammad  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) for our Divine Guidance is the perfection of Islam.

As we mentioned above, when we read the Quran or the Prophetic traditions, we find instructions regarding all aspects of life. The following are some Quranic verses and Ahaadeeth (traditions), which reflect the comprehensiveness of Islamic economic, social, religious and cultural values.
</h4>
<h2>Fair/Honest Dealing in Trading, Buying and Selling</h2>
<p>
    Allah Says (what means): “O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: and fear Allah. For Allah is well-acquainted with all that you do.”  [Quran 5:8]
</p>
<p>
    Hakim bin Hizam, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that Allah’s Messenger  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) said: “The seller and the buyer have the right to keep or return goods as long as they have not parted or till they part; and if both the parties spoke the truth and described the defects and qualities (of the goods), then they would be blessed in their transaction, and if they told lies or hid something, then the blessings of their transaction would be lost.” [Al-Bukhari]
</p>
<h2>Weighing/ Measuring of Goods for Business</h2>
<p>Allah Says (what means): “Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with an even (i.e., honest) balance. That is the best (way) and best in result.”  [Quran 17:35]

</p>
<h2>Prohibition of Bribery</h2>
<p>
    Allah Says (what means): "And do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly or send it (in bribery) to the rulers in order that (they might aid) you (to) consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin, while you know (it is unlawful).” [Quran 2:188]

‘Abdullaah bin ‘Amr bin al-’Aas, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that he heard Allah’s Messenger  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) saying: "Fornication will not appear among any people without their being punished by famine, and bribery will not appear among any people without their being punished by terror.”  [At-Tirmithi]


</p>
<h2>Avoidance of Hoarding and Monopoly</h2>
<p>The Prophet, sallallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam said: "Do not withhold your money by counting it (i.e. hoarding it), (for if you did so), Allah would also withhold His blessings from you.”  [Al-Bukhari]

</p>
<h2>Paying Salaries/Wages of Employees/Laborers on Time</h2>
<p>The Prophet  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) said:  “Allah says: ‘I will be against three persons on the Day of Resurrection:  1. One who makes a covenant in My Name, but he proves treacherous; 2. One who sells a free person (as a slave) and eats the price; and 3. One who employs a laborer and gets the full work done by him but does not pay him his wages.’”  [Al-Bukhari]
</p>
<h2>Prohibition for Fighting/Murder and Other Crimes</h2>
<p>
    Allah’s Messenger  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) said: “When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to Hell-fire.”  It was said: “O Allah’s Messenger! It is all right for the murderer but what about the murdered?  Allah’s Messenger, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam replied: “He surely had the intention to kill his companion.’” [Al-Bukhari]
</p>
<h2>Peace and Reconciliation</h2>
<p>
    Allah Says (what means): “The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto (in degree): but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah; for Allah loves not those who do wrong.”  [Quran 42:40]
</p>
<h2>Respect and Kindness to Women</h2>
<p>
    Allah Says (what means): “O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should you treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of the dower you have given them, except where they have been guilty of open lewdness.  On the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity if you take a disliking to them it may be that you dislike a thing, and Allah brings about through it a great deal of good.”  [Quran 4:19]
</p>
<h2>Kindness to the Family, Parents, Relatives, Orphans, the Poor, the Needy and the Weak</h2>
<p>
    Allah Says (what means):  “...Treat with kindness your parents and kindred, and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer; and give zakah (poor due)...”  [Quran 2:83]
</p>
<h2>Respect to Non-Muslims (People of the Book)</h2>
<p>
    Allah Says (what means): “And dispute not with the People of the Book, except in the best way; unless it be with those of them who do wrong but say: ‘We believe in the Revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; our God and your God is One; and it is to Him we submit (in Islam).’”  [Quran 29:46]

</p>
