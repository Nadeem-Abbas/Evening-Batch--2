        <span>Title Tag <br></span>
        <p>The title tag is shown in the SERPS (search engine result pages). 
            It is used as the main heading of the snippet in the search results.
            The title tag is not shown visually on a page but it is part of the page header 
            and it is also shown in the browser title. The title tag is a strong signal to search engine 
            crawlers on what the page content is all about.</p>

        <h1>Why Headings are important?</h1>
        <p>Each heading has a certain amount of semantic information attached to it. With the help of these tags, 
            writers and SEO experts can structure their content by arranging them by importance. Making it easier 
            to build the backbone of articles and webpages.
            Heading tags are HTML elements used to define the headings of a page.
            The number from 1 to 6 determines the importance and the position a heading has in the overall hierarchy 
            of the heading structure.Headings help in defining the hierarchy and the structure of the web page content.</p>
        <p>HTML offers six levels of heading tags, H1 through H6; the lower the heading level number, the greater its 
            importance â€” therefore H1 tag defines the most important heading, whereas the H6 tag defines the least 
            important heading in the document. Another reason why headings are important for SEO is that they make it easier 
            for users to navigate through the page. The user can see at a glance what the page is all about by looking at the H1 tag. 
            The rest of the headings provide a big hint to users as to what to expect in each section.

            A screen reader can use the HTML to identify the content structure and read the headings out loud.
            Headings Are Used in Featured Snippets</p>
        
        <h1> HEADER 1 OR H1</h1>
        <p> Header 1 text is usually the largest text on the page, 
            and serves as the TITLE for the content of the PAGE. If a web page is 
            a book, the H1 text will be the title of that book.
            It tells would-be readers whether that subject matter is relevant 
            to their interests.</p>
        <p> To make the text stand out, the H1 tag is usually formatted differently 
            than the rest of the page tags.The easier way to understand the use of 
            the H1 tag is to imagine that you are writing an outline of a large 
            document. The main title of your document will be your H1, your main 
            points the H2>", and sub-points the H3.</p>
        <p> The user can see at a glance what the page is all about by looking at 
            the H1 tag. The rest of the headings provide a big hint to users as 
            to what to expect in each section. So, by using keywords in your H1 tag, you help search engines 
            understand what your page is all about.</p>
