                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>A <b><i><u>tractor</b></u></i> is an engineering vehicle specifically designed to deliver a high tractive 
                    effort (or torque) at slow speeds, for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery 
                    such as that used in agriculture, mining or construction. Most commonly, the term is 
                    used to describe a farm vehicle that provides the power and traction to mechanize 
                    agricultural tasks, especially (and originally) tillage, and since many more. 
                    Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor 
                    may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanised.
                </p>
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The first powered farm implements in the early 19th century were portable engines, steam 
                    engines on wheels that could be used to drive mechanical farm machinery by way of a 
                    flexible belt. Richard Trevithick designed the first 'semi-portable' stationary steam 
                    engine for agricultural use, known as a "barn engine" in 1812, and it was used to drive 
                    a corn threshing machine.[5] The truly portable engine was invented in 1893 by William 
                    Tuxford of Boston, Lincolnshire who started manufacture of an engine built around a 
                    locomotive-style boiler with horizontal smoke tubes. A large flywheel was mounted on 
                    the crankshaft, and a stout leather belt was used to transfer the drive to the equipment 
                    being driven. In the 1850s, John Fowler used a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine to 
                    drive apparatus in the first public demonstrations of the application of cable haulage 
                    to cultivation.
                <p>
                    In parallel with the early portable engine development, many engineers attempted to 
                    make them self-propelled, the fore-runners of the traction engine. In most cases this 
                    was achieved by fitting a sprocket on the end of the crankshaft, and running a chain 
                    from this to a larger sprocket on the rear axle. These experiments met with mixed 
                    success.[6] The first proper traction engine, in the form recognisable today, was 
                    developed in 1859 when British engineer Thomas Aveling modified a Clayton & 
                    Shuttleworth portable engine, which had to be hauled from job to job by horses, 
                    into a self-propelled one. The alteration was made by fitting a long driving chain 
                    between the crankshaft and the rear axle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first half of the 1860s was a period of great experimentation but by the end of 
                    the decade the standard form of the traction engine had evolved and changed little 
                    over the next sixty years. It was widely adopted for agricultural use. The first 
                    tractors were steam-powered plowing engines. They were used in pairs, placed on either 
                    side of a field to haul a plow back and forth between them using a wire cable. 
                    In Britain Mann's and Garrett developed steam tractors for direct ploughing, 
                    but the heavy, wet soil of England meant that these designs were less economical 
                    than a team of horses. In the United States, where soil conditions permitted, steam 
                    tractors were used to direct-haul plows. Steam-powered agricultural engines remained 
                    in use well into the 20th century until reliable internal combustion engines had been 
                    developed.</p>

                    In 1892, John Froelich invented and built the first gasoline-powered tractor in Clayton 
                    County, Iowa, US. A Van Duzen single-cylinder gasoline engine was mounted on a Robinson 
                    engine chassis, which could be controlled and propelled by Froelich's gear box.
                    After receiving a patent, Froelich started up the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company 
                    and invested all of his assets. 
                    The venture was very unsuccessful, and by 1895 all was lost and he went out of business

                    Richard Hornsby & Sons are credited with producing and selling the first oil-engined 
                    tractor in Britain, invented by Herbert Akroyd Stuart. The Hornsby-Akroyd Patent Safety 
                    Oil Traction Engine was made in 1896 with a 20 hp engine. In 1897, it was bought by 
                    Mr. Locke-King, the first recorded British tractor sale. That year, it won a Silver Medal 
                    from the Royal Agricultural Society of England. It later returned to the factory for a 
                    caterpillar track fitting.

                    The first commercially successful light-weight petrol-powered general purpose tractor 
                    was built by Dan Albone, a British inventor in 1901. He filed for a patent on 
                    15 February 1902 for his tractor design and then formed Ivel Agricultural Motors Limited. 
                    The other directors were Selwyn Edge, Charles Jarrott, John Hewitt and Lord Willoughby. 
                    He called his machine the Ivel Agricultural Motor; the word "tractor" came into common 
                    use after Hart-Parr created it. The Ivel Agricultural Motor was light, powerful and compact. It had one front wheel, with a solid rubber tyre, and two large rear wheels like a modern tractor. The engine used water cooling, utilizing the thermo-syphon effect. It had one forward and one reverse gear. A pulley wheel on the left hand side allowed it to be used as a stationary engine, driving a wide range of agricultural machinery. The 1903 sale price was £300. His tractor won a medal at the Royal Agricultural Show, in 1903 and 1904. About 500 were built, and many were exported all over the world.[19] The original engine was made by Payne & Co. of Coventry. After 1906, French Aster engines were used.

                        Tractors can be generally classified by number of axles or wheels, with main categories of two-wheel tractors (single-axle tractors) and four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors); more axles are possible but uncommon. Among four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors), most are two-wheel drive (usually at the rear); but many are two-wheel drive with front wheel assist, four-wheel drive (often with articulated steering), or track crawler (with steel or rubber tracks).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The classic farm tractor is a simple open vehicle, with two very large driving wheels on an axle below and slightly behind a single seat (the seat and steering wheel consequently are in the center), and the engine in front of the driver, with two steerable wheels below the engine compartment. This basic design has remained unchanged for a number of years, but enclosed cabs are fitted on almost all modern models, for reasons of operator safety and comfort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In some localities with heavy or wet soils, notably in the Central Valley of California, the "Caterpillar" or "crawler" type of tracked tractor became popular in the 1930s, due to superior traction and flotation. These were usually maneuvered through the use of turning brake pedals and separate track clutches operated by levers rather than a steering wheel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Four-wheel drive tractors began to appear in the 1960s. Some four-wheel drive tractors have the standard "two large, two small" configuration typical of smaller tractors, while some have four large, powered wheels. The larger tractors are typically an articulated, center-hinged design steered by hydraulic cylinders that move the forward power unit while the trailing unit is not steered separately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the early 21st century, articulated or non-articulated, steerable multitrack tractors have largely supplanted the Caterpillar type for farm use. Larger types of modern farm tractors include articulated four-wheel or eight-wheel drive units with one or two power units which are hinged in the middle and steered by hydraulic clutches or pumps. A relatively recent development is the replacement of wheels or steel crawler-type tracks with flexible, steel-reinforced rubber tracks, usually powered by hydrostatic or completely hydraulic driving mechanisms. The configuration of these tractors bears little resemblance to the classic farm tractor design.

                    The predecessors of modern tractors, traction engines, used steam engines for power.
                </p>
                <h2>Gasoline and kerosene</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the turn of the 20th century, internal combustion engines have been the power source of choice. Between 1900 and 1960, gasoline was the predominant fuel, with kerosene (the Rumely Oil Pull was the most notable of this kind)being a common alternative. Generally, one engine could burn any of those, although cold starting was easiest on gasoline. Often, a small auxiliary fuel tank was available to hold gasoline for cold starting and warm-up, while the main fuel tank held whatever fuel was most convenient or least expensive for the particular farmer. In the United Kingdom, a gasoline-kerosene engine is known as a petrol-paraffin engine.

                <h3>Diesel</h3>
                <p>Dieselisation gained momentum starting in the 1960s, and modern farm tractors usually employ diesel engines, which range in power output from 18 to 575 horsepower (15 to 480 kW). Size and output are dependent on application, with smaller tractors used for lawn mowing, landscaping, orchard work, and truck farming, and larger tractors for vast fields of wheat, corn, soy, and other bulk crops.
                </p>
                <h3>Liquefied petroleum gas</h3>
                <p>
                    Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or propane also have been used as tractor fuels, but require special pressurized fuel tanks and filling equipment and produced less power, so are less prevalent in most markets.
                </p>
                <h3>Wood</h3>
                <p>
                    Durring the second world war, Petrolium based fuel was scarce in many European nations. So they resorted to using wood gasifires on every vehicle, including tractors.
                </p>
                <h3>Biodiesel</h3>
                <p>
                    In some countries such as Germany, biodiesel is often used.[24][25] Some other biofuels such as straight vegetable oil are also being used by some farmers.

                <p>
                    Most older farm tractors use a manual transmission with several gear ratios, typically three to six, sometimes multiplied into two or three ranges. This arrangement provides a set of discrete ratios that, combined with the varying of the throttle, allow final-drive speeds from less than one up to about 25 miles per hour (40 km/h), with the lower speeds used for working the land and the highest speed used on the road.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slow, controllable speeds are necessary for most of the operations performed with a tractor. They help give the farmer a larger degree of control in certain situations, such as field work. When travelling on public roads, the slow operating speeds can cause problems, such as long queues or tailbacks, which can delay or annoy motorists in cars and trucks. These motorists are responsible for being duly careful around farm tractors and sharing the road with them, but many shirk this responsibility, so various ways to minimize the interaction or minimize the speed differential are employed where feasible. Some countries (for example the Netherlands) employ a road sign on some roads that means "no farm tractors". Some modern tractors, such as the JCB Fastrac, are now capable of much higher road speeds of around 50 mph (80 km/h).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Older tractors usually have unsynchronized transmission designs, which often require the operator stop the tractor to shift between gears. This mode of use is inherently unsuited to some of the work tractors do, and has been circumvented in various ways over the years. For existing unsynchronized tractors, the methods of circumvention are double clutching or power-shifting, both of which require the operator to rely on skill to speed-match the gears while shifting, and are undesirable from a risk-mitigation standpoint because of what can go wrong if the operator makes a mistake – transmission damage is possible, and loss of vehicle control can occur if the tractor is towing a heavy load either uphill or downhill – something that tractors often do. Therefore, operator's manuals for most of these tractors state one must always stop the tractor before shifting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In these, unsynchronized transmission designs were replaced with synchronization or with continuously variable transmissions (CVTs). Either a synchronized manual transmission with enough available gear ratios (often achieved with dual ranges, high and low) or a CVT allow the engine speed to be matched to the desired final-drive speed, while keeping engine speed within the appropriate speed (as measured in rotations per minute or rpm) range for power generation (the working range) (whereas throttling back to achieve the desired final-drive speed is a trade-off that leaves the working range). The problems, solutions, and developments described here also describe the history of transmission evolution in semi-trailer trucks. The biggest difference is fleet turnover; whereas most of the old road tractors have long since been scrapped, many of the old farm tractors are still in use. Therefore, old transmission design and operation is primarily just of historical interest in trucking, whereas in farming it still often affects daily life.

                <p>
                    he power produced by the engine must be transmitted to the implement or equipment to do the actual work intended for the equipment. This may be accomplished via a drawbar or hitch system if the implement is to be towed or otherwise pulled through the tractive power of the engine, or via a pulley or power takeoff system if the implement is stationary, or a combination of the two.
                </p>
                <h2>Drawbars</h2>
                <p>
                    Plows and other tillage equipment are most commonly connected to the tractor via a drawbar. The classic drawbar is simply a steel bar attached to the tractor (or in some cases, as in the early Fordsons, cast as part of the rear transmission housing) to which the hitch of the implement was attached with a pin or by a loop and clevis. The implement could be readily attached and removed, allowing the tractor to be used for other purposes on a daily basis. If the tractor was equipped with a swinging drawbar, then it could be set at the center or offset from center to allow the tractor to run outside the path of the implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The drawbar system necessitated the implement having its own running gear (usually wheels) and in the case of a plow, chisel cultivator or harrow, some sort of lift mechanism to raise it out of the ground at turns or for transport. Drawbars necessarily posed a rollover risk depending on how the tractive torque was applied.[28] The Fordson tractor (of which more units were produced and placed in service than any other farm tractor) was prone to roll backward due to an excessively short wheelbase. The linkage between the implement and the tractor usually had some slack which could lead to jerky starts and greater wear and tear on the tractor and the equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drawbars were appropriate to the dawn of mechanization, because they were very simple in concept and because as the tractor replaced the horse, existing horse-drawn implements usually already had running gear. As the history of mechanization progressed, the advantages of other hitching systems became apparent, leading to new developments (see below). Depending on the function for which a tractor is used, though, the drawbar is still one of the usual means of attaching an implement to a tractor (see photo at left).

                    Some tractor manufacturers produced matching equipment that could be directly mounted on the tractor. Examples included front-end loaders, belly mowers, row crop cultivators, corn pickers and corn planters. In most cases, these fixed mounts were proprietary and unique to each make of tractor, so an implement produced by John Deere, for example, could not be attached to a Minneapolis Moline tractor. Another disadvantage was mounting usually required some time and labor, resulting in the implement being semi-permanently attached with bolts or other mounting hardware. Usually, it was impractical to remove the implement and reinstall it on a day-to-day basis. As a result, the tractor was unavailable for other uses and dedicated to a single use for an appreciable period of time. An implement was generally mounted at the beginning of its season of use (such as tillage, planting or harvesting) and removed when the season ended.

                <h2>Three-point and quick</h2>
                <p>
                    The drawbar system was virtually the exclusive method of attaching implements (other than direct attachment to the tractor) before Harry Ferguson developed the three-point hitch.[29] Equipment attached to the three-point hitch can be raised or lowered hydraulically with a control lever. The equipment attached to the three-point hitch is usually completely supported by the tractor. Another way to attach an implement is via a quick hitch, which is attached to the three-point hitch. This enables a single person to attach an implement quicker and put the person in less danger when attaching the implement.

                    he three-point hitch revolutionized farm tractors and their implements. While the Ferguson system was still under patent, other manufacturers developed new hitching systems to try to fend off some of Ferguson's competitive advantage. For example, International Harvester's Farmall tractors gained a two-point "Fast Hitch", and John Deere had a power lift that was somewhat similar to the more flexible Ferguson invention. Once the patent protection expired on the three-point hitch, it became an industry standard.

                    Almost every tractor today features Ferguson's three-point linkage or a derivative of it. This hitch allows for easy attachment and detachment of implements while allowing the implement to function as a part of the tractor, almost as if it were attached by a fixed mount. Previously, when the implement hit an obstacle, the towing link broke or the tractor flipped over. Ferguson's idea was to combine a connection via two lower and one upper lift arms that were connected to a hydraulic lifting ram. The ram was, in turn, connected to the upper of the three links so the increased drag (as when a plough hits a rock) caused the hydraulics to lift the implement until the obstacle was passed.

                    Recently, Bobcat's patent on its front loader connection (inspired by these earlier systems) has expired, and compact tractors are now being outfitted with quick-connect attachments for their front-end loaders.
