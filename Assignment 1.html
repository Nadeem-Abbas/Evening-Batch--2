        certain amount of semantic information attached to it. With the 
        help of these tags, writers and SEO experts can structure their content 
        by arranging them by importance. Making it easier to build the backbone 
        of articles and webpages. Heading tags are HTML elements used to define

        <h1> HEADER 1 OR H1</h1>
        <p> Header 1 text is usually the largest text on the page, 
            and serves as the TITLE for the content of the PAGE. If a web page was 
            a book, the H1 text would be the title of that book.
            It tells would-be readers whether that subject matter is relevant 
            to their interests.</p>
        <p> To make the text stand out, the H1 tag is usually formatted differently 
            than the rest of the page tags.The easier way to understand the use of 
            the H1 tag is to imagine that you are writing an outline of a large 
            document. The main title of your document will be your H1, your main 
            points the H2>", and sub-points the H3.</p>
        <p> The user can see at a glance what the page is all about by looking at 
            the H1 tag. The rest of the headings provide a big hint to users as 
            to what to expect in each section.</p>
